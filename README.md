### an easy-to-use app that records phone calls. Powered by Twilio. 

# Summary
Trifecta's mission is to provide you with an easy-to-use app to record phone calls. Imagine having a dispute with a customer support hotline, and resolving it by quickly playing back the recordings from a previous call. This app can record any phone call and save the recording for future playback. The frontend lets you place outbound calls, as well as a backend that can accept incoming calls. All of the recordings are easily viewable and playable on the frontend, where the user can look up specific calls, add a short comment or delete a recording.
